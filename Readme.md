## 👤 About Me

AI and Data leader with a decade of experience delivering enterprise-grade platforms, GenAI solutions, and intelligent automation across global enterprises, high-growth startups, and deep-tech ventures. I operate as a hands-on technologist and systems-level strategist combining architecture, code, and business alignment to drive real outcomes.

I recently led the full-stack digital foundation of a semiconductor spin-off, building ERP, QMS, HRIS, cybersecurity, and cloud systems from zero in under nine months. That journey gave me raw, first-hand insight into co-founder dynamics-navigating ambiguity, driving clarity, and scaling with conviction.

Previously, I served as founding engineer and AI lead across multiple startups. I’ve built GenAI-powered systems used by 470M+ users, designed real-time data platforms from 10GB to 1.5PB, delivered $1.2M+ in cost savings, and led global engineering teams of up to 40 across India, the EU, and the US.

Industry experience spans semiconductors, media, fintech, HR tech, e-commerce, research, manufacturing, and B2B SaaS. I translate complexity into elegant, measurable systems that serve real needs.

I hold 11+ certifications in GenAI, MLOps, cloud, and leadership from institutions like Google, Microsoft, AWS, Duke, and PMI. Recognised nationally for academic excellence (Top 10 in university, INSPIRE & Indira Awards), I’m as committed to lifelong learning as I am to execution.

Beyond the code, I’m passionate about psychology, philosophy, and the human operating system-because real systems begin with people.

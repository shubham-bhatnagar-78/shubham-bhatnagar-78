## 👤 About Me

AI and Data leader with a decade of experience delivering enterprise-grade platforms, GenAI solutions, and intelligent automation across global enterprises, high-growth startups, and deep-tech ventures. I operate as a hands-on technologist and systems-level strategist, combining architecture, code, and business alignment to drive real outcomes.

I led the full-stack digital foundation of a semiconductor spin-off, building ERP, QMS, HRIS, cybersecurity, and cloud systems from zero in under nine months. That journey gave me first-hand insight into co-founder dynamics, navigating ambiguity, driving clarity, and scaling with conviction.

Previously, I served as founding engineer and AI lead across multiple startups. I have built GenAI-powered systems used by over 470 million users, designed real-time data platforms from 10GB to 1.5PB, delivered more than 1.2 million USD in cost savings, and led global engineering teams of up to 40 across India, the EU, and the US.

My industry experience spans semiconductors, media, fintech, HR tech, e-commerce, research, manufacturing, and B2B SaaS. I translate complexity into elegant, measurable systems that serve real needs.

I hold over 11 certifications in GenAI, MLOps, cloud, and leadership from institutions such as Google, Microsoft, AWS, Duke, and PMI. Recognised nationally for academic excellence (Top 10 in university, INSPIRE and Indira Awards), I am as committed to lifelong learning as I am to execution.

Outside of work, I explore psychology, philosophy, and the human operating system. Because real systems begin with people.
